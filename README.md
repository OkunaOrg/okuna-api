#### Other issues

We're available almost 24/7 in the Okuna slack channel. [Join us!](https://join.slack.com/t/okunaorg/shared_invite/enQtNDI2NjI3MDM0MzA2LTYwM2E1Y2NhYWRmNTMzZjFhYWZlYmM2YTQ0MWEwYjYyMzcxMGI0MTFhNTIwYjU2ZDI1YjllYzlhOWZjZDc4ZWY)

#### Git commit message conventions

Help us keep the repository history consistent üôè!

We use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) as our git message convention.

If you're using git in your command line, you can download the handy tool [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli).

## Getting started

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OkunaOrg/okuna-api.git
```

#### Create and configure your .env file

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
nano .env
```

#### Install the dependencies
```bash
pipenv install
```

#### Activate the pipenv environment
```bash
pipenv shell
```

#### Run the database migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Collect the media fixtures

```bash
python manage.py collectmedia
```

#### Load the fixtures
```bash
python manage.py loaddata circles.json emoji-groups.json emojis.json badges.json categories.json languages.json
```

#### Serve with hot reload
For local API development it suffices to bind the server to localhost:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

For app development you have to bind the server to your local network:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

#### Spawn an rq-worker

We use rq-workers to process media, deliver push notifications and more.

```bash
python manage.py rqworker
```

#### Spawn an rq-scheduler

We use rq-schedulers to run one time or repetitive tasks like cleaning up failed to upload posts.

```bash
python manage.py rqscheduler
```

To schedule a job, go to the `/admin/scheduler` route.

The available jobs are

##### openbook_posts.jobs.flush_draft_posts

Cleans up all draft posts which have not being modified for a day.

Should be run every hour or so.

##### openbook_posts.jobs.curate_top_posts

Curates the top posts, which end up in the explore tab.

Should be run every 5 minutes or so.


##### openbook_posts.jobs.clean_top_posts

Cleans the top posts which should no longer be top posts.

This happens if an item is soft deleted, reported and approved

Should be run every 5 minutes or so.






#### RQ Monitoring

There are several functions that provide monitoring for the RQ workers:

- `openbook_common.jobs.verify_active_job_threshold`
- `openbook_common.jobs.verify_failed_job_threshold`
- `openbook_common.jobs.verify_active_worker_threshold`

All these functions have a required configurable `treshold`. These are configured in the Django settings.
The `FAILED_JOB_THRESHOLD` is the maximum amount of failed jobs that are allowed, before an alert is sent using the `openbook_common.jobs.send_alert_to_channel`, which sends an alert to a monitoring channel on i.e. Slack. Using the `ALERT_HOOK_URL` option in the Django settings file, it is possible to add the Slack hook URL.

Other thresholds that are included are `ACTIVE_JOB_THRESHOLD` and `ACTIVE_WORKER_THRESHOLD`. Just as with the limit on failed jobs, there is an active job and worker limit too.

In `openbook_common.utils.rq_helpers` there is also a `FailedRQJobs` class, which has a function for removing failed jobs from the queue.

It is recommended to schedule the worker monitoring functions, to run at a 5 minute interval.

## Django Translations

1. Use `./manage.py makemessages -l es` to generate messages. Doesn't matter which language we target, the translation tool is agnostic.
2. This generates a new `django.po` file in the `locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/` folder. It will have all the
source strings and a place to enter the translation strings. It doesnt overwrite previous translations.
3. Sometimes, if django is confused, it marks a string as fuzzy. So do search for  the word 'fuzzy' in `django.po`
4. If you find a fuzzy string, you can resolve it manually. Finally each string should like this
```
#: openbook_lists/validators.py:10   <- place where the string occurs in code
msgid "The list does not exist."     <- english translations  
msgstr "Die Liste ist nicht vorhanden."   <-- this will be empty for new strings
```
5. Upload this `django.po` file to https://crowdin.com/project/okuna/settings#files by pressing `Update` next to the existing `django.po` file.
6. Once all language volunteers have translated the new strings, download all the `django.po` files for each locale and 
put them in their respective folders.
7. Run `./manage.py compilemessages` to auto-generate `django.mo` files. 
8. You need to checkin both `django.po` and `django.mo` files for each locale.

### Crowdin translations update
Download the latest django.po files in the respective locale/ folders from crowdin. 
Then locally run all or some of these commands depending on which models need updating.
It will update the `.json` files, then check them in.
```$xslt
./manage.py shell < openbook_common/i18n/update_translations_emoji_groups.py

./manage.py shell < openbook_moderation/i18n/update_translations.py
./manage.py shell < openbook_categories/i18n/update_translations.py
```

## Docker Compose

### Replace .env settings
```bash
# Relational Database Service configuration
RDS_DB_NAME=okuna
RDS_USERNAME=root
RDS_PASSWORD=okuna
RDS_HOSTNAME=db.okuna
RDS_PORT=3306
RDS_HOSTNAME_READER=db.okuna
RDS_HOSTNAME_WRITER=db.okuna
```

### Build the container
```bash
usage: docker-compose build
```

### Run the container
```bash
usage: docker-compose up (-d in background)
```

### Visit the static webserver IP
http://172.16.16.1:80

### Overrides
Copy `docker-compose.override.yml.dist` to `docker-compose.override.yml` to override any settings. By default it will override the network information and fallback to localhost:80/443/3306. [Docker-Compose YML Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file)

## Troubleshooting

### macOS

#### The `pipenv install` command fails

You probably installed openssl via [Homebew](https://brew.sh/index_de), make sure to follow the instructions that are given when you type `brew info openssl`.

## FAQ

### Double logging in console

The local development server runs a separate process for the auto-reloader. You can turn off the auto-reload process by passing the --noreload flag.

````bash
python manage.py runserver --noreload
````
