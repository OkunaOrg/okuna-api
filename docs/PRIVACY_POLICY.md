This Information may include Personal Information, such as your name, but also some non-identifiable information, such as session storage properties, metadata and basic information about your device._

Okuna collects or receives information from users in different ways. We ask you to provide basic Personal Information during the registration process, such as your name and email address. Your Internet browser or device on which you are using our app collects certain information as well, such as your device/browser information and IP address.

Once you register, your name and additional information that you choose to include in your profile is public and is visible to all Users of the Service. This information may include:

- the profile picture you upload;
- your name;
- location (provided optionally by Users, Okuna does not collect it automatically);
- ther information that you decide to include in the &quot;Bio&quot; section of your Profile.

## **3.1. Usage Information**

Okuna will inevitably collect some usage information automatically when you visit and/or use the Service and store it in log files. This information refers mainly to the technical information about your use of the Service through your internet browser or mobile device and is necessary for the correct technical functioning of the Service. We use this information to administer the Service and better tailor the Site and our Services to our users&#39; needs.

This information may include, but is not limited to:

- **Usage information** – refers to the information that is uploaded to the Service and stored in log files. It relates to how you use the Service. When you use a mobile device to access our Service, we may access, collect, and/or monitor one or more &quot;device identifiers&quot;. These are small data files stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. However, we only collect and store those identifiers for **session management.** After a User finishes a session, the device identifiers are deleted from our logs.
- **Services Metadata –** Metadata is usually technical information that is associated with your use of the Service or any Content you post. For example, metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of user Content was posted and how that Content is formatted. Okuna processes metadata for the least amount of time possible and only enough for the application to function properly. The content you post is stripped off of metadata during the initial stage of processing.
- **Session management cookies –** we use this mechanism to store session information for a particular user. When a User logs into the Service, his/her session ID will be stored on the server until he logs out. A session is initiated when a User logs onto the Service and is terminated when he or she logs out. The User&#39;s Session ID is a random string of numbers and is non-identifiable on its own. The User&#39;s Session ID is &#39;assigned&#39; to the User and each time the User logs into the service, he/she retrieves that assigned key.

## **3.2. Communications Information**

We enable Users to communicate with each other through the commenting functionality under posts.

We advise not to disclose any personal information, and especially any sensitive personal information such as health/genetic information, racial/religious/ethnic background, etc. in comments.

automated package vulnerability scanners – which scan the system for known vulnerabilities and automatically prepare and implement a patch which will fix the vulnerability.
